## AI Data Analysis Project (R)

An academic project that applies basic data analysis and classification concepts using the R programming language.  
The project uses the built-in **mtcars** dataset to examine the relationship between fuel efficiency and acceleration performance based on the number of engine cylinders.

## Objective
To classify cars into groups (4, 6, and 8 cylinders) and visualize how engine size affects fuel efficiency (mpg) and quarter-mile time (qsec).

## Tools
- R Programming Language
- Built-in mtcars dataset
- Base R visualization functions

## What Was Done
- Selected relevant variables from the dataset
- Classified cars by cylinder count
- Visualized data using a scatter plot
- Interpreted the results

## Files
- `DS363_project.R` – R script used for the analysis
- `AI Project and Case Study.pdf` – Anonymized project report
